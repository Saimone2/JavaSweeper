# java-sweeper
The well-kniwn game Minesweeper written in Java. A 9x9 playing field contains 10 bombs. The cells indicate the number of bombs around them, when you click on a closed bomb, it's game over. The next click starts a new game.

The first open cell cannot be a bomb. With the right mouse button, you can check the boxes where the bomb may be found. If a sufficient number of check boxes are collected around the cell, then you can open the surrounding fields by double-clicking.

If the player did not guess that there is a bomb under the cell and placed a flag, then at the end of the game he can see the entire playing field and his mistakes.
